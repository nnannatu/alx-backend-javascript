# TypeScript Project

This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps to write more maintainable and scalable code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

You will also need to have TypeScript installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
